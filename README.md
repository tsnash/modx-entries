# Entries
A set of MODX Evolution snippets centered around creating and retrieving information from a database as dynamic content.

## Purpose
Entries began as a blog developed within the [MODX Evolution](http://modx.com/download/evolution/) CMS that sought to avoid creating a dedicated resource for each individual entry.  Moving forward, this project aims to become something that any developer can learn from and use right away.

## Closed and Open Source
Currently the closed source version is still live and there are substantial differences between what is being used and what is public. The idea is to gradually make the open source version into something simpler, more customizable and more robust with sufficient examples of how to use Entries in its entirety. Any changes will be updated accordingly.

# Entries
A set of MODX Evolution snippets centered around creating and retrieving information from a database as dynamic content.

## Purpose
Entries began as a blog developed within the [MODX Evolution](http://modx.com/download/evolution/) CMS. The objective was to avoid having to create a dedicated resource for each individual entry. This was accomplished by pulling data from a database, parsing that data, and passing it to various HTML templates. Moving forward, this project aims to be something that any developer can learn from and use right away while contributing and personalizing for their own use.
